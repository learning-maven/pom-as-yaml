# POM as YAML

Thanks to [polyglot-maven](https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven) project, we can write our Project Object Model (POM) in dialects other than XML.
This project is such an example and POM is written in YAML instead of XML.

In order to enable a specific dialect, add `.mvn/extensions.xml` file to your project and add the corresponding dialect extension.
